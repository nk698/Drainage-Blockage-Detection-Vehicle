3. Reliability:
The robot must be capable of operating for a minimum of 8 hours on a single charge.
The system must have built-in fail-safes for navigation in case of sensor failure (e.g., fallback mode, stop and alert operator).
4. Security:
Communication between the robot and the operator should be secured using encryption.
The software should have user authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
5. Usability:
The operator interface (via Bluetooth) should be intuitive, with clear controls for navigation and sensor data visualization.
