Testing for Autonomous System for Detecting Drainage Blockages
1. Unit Testing
Unit tests were conducted on each individual component of the system to ensure they functioned as expected. This included testing the sensors, motors, communication modules, and the core processing unit (Raspberry Pi).

Sensors Testing: Verified the output from ultrasonic and infrared sensors for accuracy in detecting obstacles.
Motor Testing: Ensured DC motors and stepper motors responded correctly to control commands and moved the robot in expected directions.
Camera Testing: Checked if the high-definition camera and infrared camera were correctly capturing images of the drainage system for further analysis.
2. Integration Testing
Integration testing involved checking the interaction between different modules, including hardware and software components.

Sensor Integration: Ensured data from multiple sensors were being received and processed accurately by the Raspberry Pi.
Communication Integration: Verified Bluetooth communication between the robot and the operator system was stable, and the data transmission was smooth.
System Integration: Tested the combination of sensors, navigation, and camera systems to ensure the robot could perform blockage detection and movement through the drainage network autonomously.
3. Field Testing
Field tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the robot in real-world conditions.

Blockage Detection: The robot successfully detected blockages in various types of drainage pipes, including narrow and curved sections.
Navigation in Complex Environments: The robot was tested in urban drainage systems with complex layouts, and its ability to navigate and map out the system was evaluated.
Time Efficiency: Compared the time taken by the robot for blockage detection against traditional manual methods, with the robot showing a 40% reduction in inspection time.
4. Performance Testing
Performance testing focused on evaluating the robotâ€™s speed, battery life, and reliability over extended use.

Speed: The robot was tested for its speed in detecting and navigating through the drainage system.
Battery Life: Battery performance was monitored, ensuring the robot could complete an entire inspection cycle without recharging.
Stability: The robot was tested for stability during long-duration runs, ensuring it did not encounter errors or crashes.
5. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
User acceptance testing was performed to ensure that the system met the needs of the intended users (maintenance teams).

Ease of Use: The user interface for operators was tested to ensure it was intuitive and simple to navigate.
Operator Feedback: Maintenance team members provided feedback on system performance and usability, helping refine the final design.
6. Regression Testing
Each new feature added to the system was followed by regression testing to ensure that the system continued to function as expected without breaking existing functionalities.

Feature Testing: New updates, such as the addition of real-time monitoring and GPS integration, were tested to ensure compatibility with existing systems.
System Stability: The overall stability of the robot and its systems was tested after updates to ensure reliability in continuous operation.
7. Results and Improvements
Field and integration testing showed significant improvements in drainage system maintenance efficiency and safety. Based on testing feedback, future improvements include:

Enhanced Camera Accuracy: Improving image resolution for more precise blockage detection.
Battery Optimization: Exploring energy-efficient power systems for longer operation times.
